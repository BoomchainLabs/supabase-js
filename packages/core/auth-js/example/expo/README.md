# Todo app


## Getting start


This only works with yarn, as npm will create a symlink to the parent directory inside node_modules/, which Metro can't deal with: [expo/create-react-native-app#214](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app/issues/214).

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

This will start a session in your terminal/browser. You can scan the QR code with your phone to load this project inside the Expo app.
